# Critical TechWorks - Android News App Challenge

A modern, offline-first news application for Android built with 100% Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, showcasing a robust implementation of Clean Architecture principles. This app fetches top headlines from a news API, provides a detailed view for each article, and includes advanced features like biometric security and persistent user preferences.

## ‚ú® Features Implemented

-   **Dynamic News Feed**: Displays a list of top headlines from a selected news source.
-   **Offline Caching**: Implements a Single Source of Truth (SSoT) pattern using Room. The app is fully functional offline, showing the last fetched data.
-   **Pull-to-Refresh**: Users can swipe down to refresh the news feed with the latest articles.
-   **Article Detail View**: A dedicated screen to display the full image, title, description, and content of a selected article.
-   **Dynamic Source Selection**: A dropdown menu allows users to switch between different news sources at runtime.
-   **Persistent User Preferences**: The user's chosen news source is saved and restored across app sessions using Jetpack DataStore.
-   **Biometric Authentication**: On launch, the app requires fingerprint authentication if available and configured on the device, providing an extra layer of security.
-   **Comprehensive Unit Tests**: Extensive unit test coverage for ViewModels, UseCases, Repositories, and Mappers ensures code reliability and robustness.
-   **Internationalization (i18n)**: The app is prepared for a global audience with string resources for both English (default) and Portuguese.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

This project follows the principles of **Clean Architecture**, separating concerns into three distinct layers:

-   **`UI Layer`**: Built entirely with **Jetpack Compose** and **Material 3**. It follows the **MVVM** pattern, with ViewModels exposing state via `StateFlow` in a Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF) manner.
-   **`Domain Layer`**: The core of the application. It is a pure Kotlin module containing the business logic (**UseCases**) and main data models. It is completely independent of the Android framework.
-   **`Data Layer`**: Manages all data operations. It uses the **Repository pattern** to abstract data sources and implements a **Single Source of Truth (SSoT)** strategy, where the Room database is the canonical source of data for the UI.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Configuration

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Get an API Key:** This project uses the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/). You will need to get a free API key from their website.
3.  **Create `local.properties` file:** In the root directory of the project, create a file named `local.properties`.
4.  **Add your API key:** Inside `local.properties`, add the following line, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key you obtained:
    ```properties
    API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
5.  Open the project in Android Studio and run it. Gradle will handle the rest.

## üöÄ Future Improvements

-   **Instrumented Tests**: Add tests for the Room DAO and UI Composables.
-   **Paging**: Implement the Paging 3 library for infinite scrolling of headlines.
-   **Dynamic Source List**: Fetch the list of available news sources from the API instead of using a hardcoded list.
-   **Search Functionality**: Add a search bar to find articles by keywords.
